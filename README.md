#  Risk Game (C++ Terminal Version)

This repository contains a **C++ implementation** of the classic **Risk** board game, playable directly from the terminal.  

The project was developed as an academic exercise to apply **data structures** and **algorithmic concepts**, including:

- **Graphs**: to represent the game map and the connections between territories.  
- **Lists**: to manage players, armies, and moves.  
- **Pathfinding algorithms** (including **Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm**): to calculate optimal routes and strategies within the game.  

## ðŸš€ Compilation and Execution

Make sure you have **g++** installed. Then compile the project with:

```bash
g++ -std=c++11 -o risk *.cpp *.cxx
```
